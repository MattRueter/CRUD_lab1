# CRUD_lab1

## Purpose:
A simple CRUD app to play around with Express server concepts recenlty learned / reviewed.

- Before developing a back-end for one of my "real" apps I wanted to use this as a place to think about writing cleaner code by making use of Express.Router.
- Decided to use Pug for template views since I hadn't used it before.
